<h2>releases</h2>

<p>
  This page contains all bliss group releases (please visit the member
  page for individual member releases).
</p>
<p>
  All the files available here contain an executable + data
  you can run out of the box on any recent Microsoft Windows 
  (DirectX 7 or newer required).
</p>
<p>
  The .zip files also contain the full source for you to compile on
  Linux (if you try other unices, let me know what problems come up 
  --warp), GGI is required. (it seems SDL is included with more and
  more distributions, so I guess I should provide SDL versions some
  day :)

  Bob is warp's 32k game compo entry for
  <a href="http://ms.demo.org">Mekka &amp; Symposium</a>
  2001, it got 7th place.
</p>

<p>
  Bob is a 2 player pc re-implementation of a classic 
  c64 game called jawbreaker. It was coded by warp in C on an
  old pentium 133MHZ, the code is a lot cleaner and better
  optimized compared to 8bit :).

  <br />warp used drug powerup on avoozl.
</p>

<p>
  The music was made by tharsis and the player is a hybrid of
  fxmp-0.0.21 and fxmp-0.0.22-pre2 with some size optimizations.

  We got 3rd place in the Bizarre 2000 intro compo with 8bit.
  8bit was mostly coded by warp in C++. The code is not
  optimized at all and the intro thus requires a 500MHZ cpu
  to run smooth. Sorry about that :)
