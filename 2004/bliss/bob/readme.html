    <A name="intro"><H2>introduction</H2></A>
    <P>Hi!</P>
    <P>You're reading the readme for bob, 
    which is a 32k game for the game compo at
    <A HREF="http://ms.demo.org">mekka & symposium</A> 2001.
    bob is heavily inspired by jawbreaker (on commodore
    64), it can be considered as a pc re-implementation
    for two players.</P>
    <P>Don't hesitate to send me a message if you're having
    trouble with this release, or want to send me feedback
    in the form of flames or patches or whatnot.</P>
    <P class="sig">-- 
    <A HREF="mailto:warp-tmt@dds.nl">warp</A> of
    <A HREF="http://www.demonic.demon.nl">bliss</A>.</P>
    <P>ps. fxmp doesn't play the tunes entirely as intended - most
    players don't - so please have a listen in FastTracker 2 if you
    have any interest in chip music. The original .xm's are in
    <TT>src/data.src/</TT>.</P>

    <A name="system"><H2>system requirements</H2></A>
    <P>This game tries to run in a 400x300 256 colour
    videomode, if it cannot obtain this it will fall
    back to a windowed mode which emulates the 256
    colour mode on top of a 15/16/24 or 32 bit mode.</P>
    <P>I guess you need about 166mhz or 200mhz if your 
    system supports the 400x300 8bpp mode (most of it runs
    fine on my 133mhz pentium, but some of the powerups
    are a bit sluggish on that box :). If the 
    windowed mode is used you need a faster machine.<P>
    <P>Other then that you currently need Microsoft
    DirectX 7 (or, if you're brave enough - you can
    try the Linux/GGI port).</P>
    <P>Also, this game tries to do its timing on the
    vertical retrace, so if you can adjust it somewhere
    you're advised to set the refreshrate in 400x300 to 
    70hz for smooth display.</P>

    <A name="linux"><H2>linux port</H2></A>
    <P>Smoke was kind enough to port my DirectDraw and
    Direct Input code to GGI. There are still strange bugs
    due to the nature of GGI and DirectInput.</P>
    <P>To build bob <TT>cd</TT> into
    <TT>src/GNU</TT> and type <TT>make</TT>. You can
    also try <TT>make release</TT> if you want to
    compress the binary with upx.</P>
    <P>Bob will should run as intended using the
    svgalib target, but this is untested :), use 8bpp or
    <TT>GGI_DISPLAY=palemu</TT> in X.</P>
    <P>For smooth display in X you may need to change the
    scheduling in the linux kernel - change the 
    <TT>#define HZ 100</TT> into something like 1024
    in <TT>linux/include/asm-i386/param.h</TT>.</P>

    <A name="#options"><H2>command line options</H2></A>
    <P>With command line options you can force <EM>quiet
    mode</EM> and/or <EM>windowed mode</EM>, e.g.</P>
    
    <P><TT>d:\ms2001\32kgame>
    bob&nbsp;in&nbsp;a&nbsp;window,&nbsp;please.</TT></P>
    <P>or</P>
    <P><TT>d:\ms2001\32kgame>
    bob&nbsp;could&nbsp;you&nbsp;be&nbsp;quiet?</TT></P>
    <P>or both</P>
    <P><TT>d:\ms2001\32kgame>
    bob&nbsp;--window&nbsp;--quiet</TT></P>

    <A name="#story"><H2>story</H2></A>
    <P>once upon a time there was a snowman.
    a snowman called bob, which is a very
    good name for a snowman. this snowman
    called bob had a friend called bob.
    which seems rather confusing, but bob
    didn't mind, and neither did bob.</P>
    <P>one day, bob and bob had an argument,
    and they stopped talking to each other.
    but then they got real lonely on
    christmas, and so both of them decided
    to make a new friend out of snow. when
    bob saw what bob was doing things got
    really ugly while both of them tried
    to sabotage the other's progress...</P>
    <P>so, this is where you people come in,
    please help bob and bob create their
    friend out of snow.</P>

    <A name="options"><H2>options</H2></A>
    <P>Before you start playing you should configure
    the players (select options -> p1 setup):</P>
    <UL>
    <LI>keymap: select qwerty or dvorak (sorry,
    no german, french, italian, etc. keymap support).
    <LI>name: enter your name.
    <LI>controls: game controls, note that the action
    and escape keys are only used in the menus and not
    in the game itself.
    <LI>radix: select binary, octal, decimal or 
    hexadecimal display for score and powerup timeouts.
    </UL>
    <P>
    When you've configured both players choose save setup
    to save this configuration - it will be automatically
    loaded the next time you run the game.</P>

    <A name="game"><H2>playing the game</H2></A>
    <P>Now, select start game to start. The objective
    is to gather all snow on your half of the screen.
    you will encounter evil mutant snowmen which are 
    best avoided and the obligatory powerups, described 
    below.</P>
    <P>The game ends when either player dies or gathers
    all snow.
    </P>
    <P>To control your character, just press a key once.
    So, if you want to go up, press the up key once, bob
    will wait for a hole to come by and go up when he's
    allowed to do so (move right or left to cancel it).
    Press left once for left, and if you want bob
    to stop press left again. Same principle for right and
    down (the action and escape keys aren't used in the 
    game).</P>

    <A name="powerups"><H2>powerups</H2></A>
    <P>
    A number of delicious powerups will appear magically
    in the game arena, they all have an effect on either
    you or your opponent for a certain amount of time (and
    other powerups cannot be used on this player while such 
    a timer is active).</P>
    <P>

    <IMG src="img/hole.gif"     width="22" height="22">

    </P>

    <A name="score"><H2>score</H2></A>
    <P>Here's a list of things which increase your score (points in decimal):
    </P>
    <UL>
    <LI>+ 1 point for eating a dot of snow.
    <LI>+30 points for eating all snow.
    <LI>+20 points for the opponent if you die.
    <LI>+10 points for eating an evil mutant snowman (during food! powerup).
    <LI>+10 points for a narrow escape (moving up/down with an evil mutant snowman near).
