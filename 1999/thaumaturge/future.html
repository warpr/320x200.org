    <p>
      We are currently migrating from our birth environment to the new
      environments which have come across our paths. That is, we used
      to make procedural intel x86 assembly code for the MS-Dos pseudo
      operating system and we're moving to object oriented platform
      independent C++ code for 32-bit operating systems (Unix, Windows).
    </p>
    <p>When we're ready we'll resume our quest to create a
      production (demo or intro) which will be shown on a big screen
      at a dutch demo party during the compo and which will not get
      last in said compo.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of our members are working on side projects, most
      of these exist only in the mind of it's conceiver, some however are
      actually being worked on.
