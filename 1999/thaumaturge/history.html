      <LI>Aap/Acme and Tharsis got it into their heads to organize a so-called
	flippo-party - which was to be held at the monthly SuccesS meeting in
	Utrecht (the Netherlands). Somehow Shako got involved which resulted in
	a us creating an invitation intro for the event. This "fliptro" features
	art by Sunday/Mistery and music by Harlequin/SuccesS.
      <LI>Shortly after SiH'95 Shako leaves Thaumaturge to work on other
	projects
      <LI>At Bizarre 1995 we attempted to get our intro "smurfig" on the big screen,
