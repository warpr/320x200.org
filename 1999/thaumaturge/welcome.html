    <H3>Welcome...</H3>
    <p>
      Welcome to the Thaumaturge homepage v0.4.8. This homepage provides
      information about the dutch demo group Thaumaturge and it's
      members.

    <h3>About this page...</h3>
    <p>
      The visible appearance of this
      page was created using Cascading Style Sheets, it has been
      tested on a few browsers of which - at the time of writing - only
      Internet Explorer 4 (or newer) displays it properly, Netscape 
      Communicator 4 implements CSS1 quite poorly, I assume this will be corrected in
      future versions. In the meantime I advise Unix users to view the page
      with Lynx, for these pages are Lynx Enhanced.</p>
