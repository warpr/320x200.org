Hellboy FAQ

A few years ago, I got stuck in a game called Hellboy: Asylum Seeker (aka
[Hellboy: Dogs of the Night](http://www.mobygames.com/game/hellboy-dogs-of-the-night)). 
At the time I did not find an FAQ for this game, so I started taking notes 
myself.  Eventually this turned into the Hellboy FAQ, get it 
[here](http://320x200.org/attic/files/hellboy.txt) or at 
[GameFAQs](http://www.gamefaqs.com/computer/doswin/game/12676.html).
