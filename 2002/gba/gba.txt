gameboy advance

I have been working on some gameboy advance related projects, here are some
toys:

womb-0.3.1 is a linux kernel module for the dumb multiboot cable designed by Ajo at 
[GBA Multiboot Inteligent Cable](http://web.archive.org/web/20031101141836/http://ajo.thinknerd.com/gba/). 
The kernel module turns out to be less reliable compared to the dos version, even 
though it should have full control of the machine during transfer (more research 
required :). The module needs devfs, and has so far only been used with kernel 2.4.x.

Womb started life as a direct dos port of Ajo's dmb, this version seems to be more 
reliable on the machines I have tested it on. (if you are using a win32 system, you 
may need a tool such as winzip to extract .tar.gz files).

fairy-0.2.18 is a little test screen I wrote to play with the sprite registers.
