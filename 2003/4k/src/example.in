I have put together a framework which you can use as a starting point,
the overhead in these examples is 244 bytes for SDL, 195 for GL, and
256 for glut.
So you still have around 3800 bytes for actual code :).

<p>A Makefile for building with gnu make is included, but creating a
project for MSVC or CodeWarrior should be fairly straightforward (<a
href="http://www.libsdl.org">www.libsdl.org</a> has some info
on this, and if someone wants to contribute their workspace/project file, 
please do :).</p>
