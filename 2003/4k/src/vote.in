  Four entries have been submitted to the compo, they are:
</p>
<ul>
  <li> 3d by jylam </li>
  <li> randomname by termos and styx </li>
  <li> different wavelengths in the visible spectrum by spectre/flare </li>
  <li> Lollipop hogwagen by tonic </li>
</ul>
<p>
  <a href="4ksrc-pack1.zip">4ksrc-pack1.zip</a> (40kb) contains all
  the entries + a votesheet.  If you are on windows and don't have
  glut.dll and sdl.dll in your path, you should get <a
  href="4ksrc-pack1-glut-sdl.zip">4ksrc-pack1-glut-sdl.zip</a> (229kb) 
  instead -- it contains all the entries, and the .dlls required to run
  them on win32.
