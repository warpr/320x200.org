  <a href="4ksrc-pack1.zip">4ksrc-pack1.zip</a> (40kb) contains all
  the entries.  If you are on windows and don't have
  glut.dll and sdl.dll in your path, you should get <a
  href="4ksrc-pack1-glut-sdl.zip">4ksrc-pack1-glut-sdl.zip</a> (229kb) 
  instead -- it contains all the entries, and the .dlls required to run
  them on win32.

<h1 class="pagetitle">thanks</h1>
<p>
  Thanks to all the participants for entering the compo!
</p>
<p>
  Despite having only 4 entries the compo turned out te be quite
  exciting!  Also thanks to those who tried to enter but didn't make
  the deadline.
</p>
<p>
  I will try to find someone to organize a sequel to this 4k source
  compo in a few months.  Or perhaps some of you want to impose some
  other arbitrary limits instead of the 4k source limit?
  Whatever you want, please visit us
  in #demoscene (<a href="http://freenode.net">freenode
  irc</a>) to discuss this and other topics!
