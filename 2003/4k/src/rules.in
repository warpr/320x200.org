<ol>
  <li>The source code for your entry should be less then (or equal to)
  4096 bytes.</li>
  <li>Only ANSI C and C++ are allowed.</li>
  <li>You have to use <a href="http://www.libsdl.org">SDL</a> (or glut).</li>
  <li>No other API calls allowed.</li>
  <li>No external data files, just code.</li>
  <li>Sound is allowed.</li> 
  <li>ESC quits.</li>

<h2>detailed rules</h2>
<p>
Some of these rules may seem a bit harsh, but please keep in mind this
is an open source compo.  Most of these rules deal with getting your
code to be portable - the voters would like to be able to run your
entry on Win32, GNU/Linux, and even Mac OSX.</p>
<ol>
  <li>The size limit for all the source code in the project is 4096
  bytes, this doesn't include makefiles/projects or whatever you use
  to build it. Whitespace (space/tab/newlines) is not counted for the
  size limit, however the `real' size of your source files should not
   grow beyond 8192 bytes.<br />&nbsp;<br />
  The real size of your source files is the size you see with
  <b><tt>dir</tt></b> or <b><tt>ls -l</tt></b> (this should be &lt;=
  8192 bytes).<br />  We're using the
  following command to calculate the size without counting whitespace
  (should be &lt;= 4096 bytes):
  <pre>

       cat source.c | perl -pe 's/\s//g' | wc -c
  </pre>
  Using compiler switches to add source code at compile time is
  strictly prohibited (that means no funky -D tricks in the Makefile
  guys).
  <br />
  </li>
  
  <li>You are not allowed to use compiler extensions, only ANSI C
  and/or C++ is allowed.</li>

  <li>You have to use <a href="http://www.libsdl.org">LibSDL</a> to
  get a video buffer to play with :).  This cuts down on overhead for
  the window init and msg loop and it's portable too.  If you really
  want you can use glut too instead of SDL.<br />
  <b>note</b>: only stock SDL is
  allowed - do NOT use any of the additional libraries). </li>

  <li>You cannot use any OS specific libraries or API calls - i.e. No
  Direct3D or other Windows API calls (and no X11 either).  OpenGL is
  allowed if you really want it :)</li>

  <li>No data files are allowed, we might allow this in a future
  edition of the compo, but for now just use your mad coding skillz
  :)</li>

  <li>Sound is allowed with SDL audio or <a
  href="http://www.openal.org">OpenAL</a> (don't use /dev/dsp or
  something like that directly).</li> 

  <li>Pressing escape should quit the intro.</li>
</ol>
