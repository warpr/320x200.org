<h2>submitting</h2>
<p>
  To submit an entry, prepare a .zip file or tarball (.tar.gz or
  .tar.bz2) with the following contents:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>the source code for your entry</li>
  <li>any Makefiles, project workspaces, batch files and shell scripts
      you use to build your entry</li>
  <li>a file_id.diz is appreciated, but not required.</li>
  <li>any other info files you wish to include.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  <b>NOTE</b>: DO NOT SUBMIT ANY EXECUTABLES.

<h2>notes</h2>
<p>
  If you need/want specific compiler switches to get the best
  perfomance out of your entry, please include a seperate .txt file
  with build instructions).
</p>

<p>
  If I cannot build your entry you risk the chance of being
  disqualified (presumably because it's not portable).  I will contact
  you by email or on #demoscene (<a href="http://freenode.net">freenode
  irc</a>) if I have trouble building your entry - so you might want
  to submit your entry a little early to make sure you have enough
  time to fix any trouble should this occur.
