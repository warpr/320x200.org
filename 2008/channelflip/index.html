        <div class="post"><h1>more garr.</h1>
<p>I enjoyed watching <a href="http://blip.tv/file/461611/">play:digital</a>
   on channelflip/blip.tv ever since I discovered it.  I subscribed to their rss
   feed and watched every episode as soon as it was available, yay rss bla bla.  A
   few months ago, new episodes stopped appearing - it took me a while to notice,
   but there was no explanation everywhere.
</p>
<p>Today I discovered they've been back since the beginning of june, with probably
   weekly episodes.  garr!   Do they really hate their audience that much that
   they won't even take the trouble to tell them on the old rss feed that the show
   is now new and improved and has a new rss feed?
</p>
<p>They're not the first to do that to me either.  If you're going to change your
   feed address, fucking post about it using the old address to let ppl know about
   it, how hard is it?
</p>
<p>more garr.  GARR.
