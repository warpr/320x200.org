Hello! CMS

Hello! CMS is a content management system designed for personal homepages. It
allows a single person to easily edit any part of a website without the hassle
of backend/frontend seperation used by larger content management systems or the
inflexible nature of blogging applications.

I am no longer maintaining it, but its site is still live at 
[www.hello-cms.org](http://www.hello-cms.org).
