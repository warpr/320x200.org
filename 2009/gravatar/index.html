        <div class="post"><h1>Profiling for fun and profit (using gravatars).</h1>
<p>I have been using sites which use gravatars for quite some time.  I probably
   saw them first on blog posts, but more recently many websites such as 
   stackoverflow, uservoice, userscripts, etc..  have all started using gravatars.
</p>
<p>I assume you know what gravatars are, if not, please have a quick look at
   <a href="http://www.gravatar.com">www.gravatar.com</a>, and come back here afterward.
</p>
<p>So, gravatars.  My gravatar looks like this:
</p>
<img src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/28f68a836b57094162e2b56f4c5c73aa?s=96" />

<p>The url for that image is http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/28f68a836b57094162e2b56f4c5c73aa?s=96.
</p>
<p>I signed up at gravatar.com, uploaded a picture, and that's what my gravatar is.  You
   can do this too.  If you do not, gravatar will give you an identicon:
</p>
<img src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ec9385dc533f1a6a93769077f852503e?s=96&d=identicon" />

<p>Or a monsterid:
</p>
<img src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ec9385dc533f1a6a93769077f852503e?s=96&d=monsterid" />

<p>Or a different default image chosen by the site operator.  In all cases, the image you see on your 
   user profile on stackoverflow is the same image you see on uservoice, or on a blog post, or
   on libre.fm, etc.  This works because every time you make a blog post, or sign up for some site, 
   you enter an email address.  Most people use the same email address for all the
   sites they visit.  The site you visit turns your email address into a gravatar
   url.  <br />
</p>
<p>How you calculate the gravatar url from an email address is documented <a href="http://en.gravatar.com/site/implement/url">here</a>.
   When I follow those instructions, I get this:
</p>
<p>http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/28f68a836b57094162e2b56f4c5c73aa.jpg
</p>
<p>Which, as you may have noticed is almost the same url I mentioned at the start of my post.  Which 
   is the url stackoverflow puts on my profile page.  It is also the same url used when I comment on 
   the musicbrainz blog, or the same url on my libre.fm profile page.  And remember, most of these 
   sites will always publish that url, whether you have signed up at gravatar or not.  Now isn't 
   that interesting?  <br />
</p>
<p>Let's say I have a list of email addresses harvested from some place, and I want to figure
   out if they're coders so I can send them targeted spam.  Let's figure out what they call
   themselves too, so I can address them as &quot;Dear <name>,&quot;.  To do that, I will have to find 
   some way to get all gravatar urls from stackoverflow.  How hard would that be?
</p>
<p>It turns out that for stackoverflow, it is quite simple.  Stackoverflow uses 
   sequential userids, so it took me only a few minutes to generate urls to every single 
   profile url on stackoverflow.  I then ran a script to fetch all those urls (with a 1 
   second pause between fetches because I did not want to hammer their servers too much). 
   I used a few separate servers simultaneously and had all stackoverflow profiles the 
   next morning.
</p>
<p>userscripts.org and uservoice.com also have gravatars and use sequential userids, so
   would be just as easy to fetch.  And when you've harvested them once, it will be even 
   easier to fetch only the new profiles every day to keep your gravatar database updated.
   A site which doesn't use sequential userids is a bit harder to harvest, but I think for 
   most sites this shouldn't be much of a problem.
</p>
<p>As a proof-of-concept, I needed something to compare my nice collection of stackoverflow
   gravatars with.  So I also fetched the gravatars from everyone who commented
   on the issues at musicbrainz.uservoice.com and everyone who commented on blog posts at
   blog.musicbrainz.org.  I am not going to publish any user profiles here, but from my 
   very limited set of uservoice/blog harvesting I could match 27 musicbrainz people to 
   their stackoverflow accounts.  Most of these used more-or-less the same name or nick 
   on both sites, so it would've been easy to link them anyway -- but that is <b>their</b>
   choice.  Some do use different names, and may want to keep these identities separate, 
   which obviously they have a right to.
</p>
<p>So, how serious is all this?
</p>
<p>The more sites start using gravatar, the more interesting information can be
   collected about their users.  What if a torrentsite like thepiratebay uses
   gravatars?  Or facebook?  Or an adult site?  A dating site?  A site about
   dieting?  A site about your weird furry roleplaying fetish?  You may not want
   those identities linked.  If you know how gravatar works, you can work around
   this by using a different email address for each identity.  But if you don't,
   how would you know those sites are publishing information about you which can
   tie you to other sites?  www.gravatar.com doesn't mention that, the sites using
   gravatar do not mention that.   And remember, in almost all cases, there is
   <b>no</b> opt-out: the gravatar url will be published whether you actually have
   a gravatar or not.
</p>
<p>So, to conclude.  If you are running a site which uses gravatars, please allow 
   users to turn them off, and more importantly, educate your users on the risks.
</p>
<p>Thank you for reading :)
