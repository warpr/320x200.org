mpdscribble is a music player daemon client which submits information about
tracks being played to audioscrobbler.

I originally wrote mpdscribble as I was not entirely happy with mpdscrobbler.
However, I am no langer maintaining it.  Max Kellermann has taken over
development, you will find his versions on the 
[mpd wiki](http://mpd.wikia.com/wiki/Client:Mpdscribble).  Old versions
are archived [here](/attic/mpdscribble/).
